The acting in Peaky Blinders is nothing short of phenomenal. The cast led by Cillian Murphy is one of the best cast I have seen on television. The visuals and the cinematography are beautifully done and the writing is some of the best writing I have ever seen.

                   <p>If you were thinking, “Peaky Blinders is a strange name for serious crime drama”, that’s because it’s taken from real life. The whole series is loosely based on a real criminal gang known as the Peaky Blinders, who rose to prominence in Birmingham during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
