              <h1>Money Hiest (Origin-Spanish)</h1>
              <article>
                   <p>La Casa de Papel (a.k.a Money Heist), one of our favorite Spanish-language shows on Netflix, is definitely returning for                          season 5. However, this news is bittersweet:Premiering in two parts in 2021, the show's fifth season will be its last.
                      Money Heist is a crime drama on Netflix - originally called La Casa de Papel. The plot reads: "Eight thieves take hostages                       and lock themselves in the Royal Mint of Spain as a criminal mastermind manipulates the police to carry out his plan."

                   <p>The story of Money Heist revolves around elaborate heists orchestrated by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), who steals money                       from banks and has a code not to harm anyone in the process. Money Heist season 1 follows the job at the Royal Mint of                            Spain, and season 2 focuses on robbing the Bank of Spain. Both heists see the Professor call the shots as his team of                             robbers with city-themed code names attempt to stick to the intricate plans. But, thanks to the longevity of the heists and                       various flashbacks, the Money Heist timeline can be a bit confusing.
                   </p>
                   <p>Before the Professor was involved in any heists, the idea to attempt them came from his father. The Professor's father was                       a criminal who told him about his plan for the perfect heist, which became the inspiration for the Royal Mint of Spain heist years later. This predates the main story of Money Heist, and it is revealed in season 2 that the plan for the Bank of Spain heist was in the works before season 1.<br>
<br>
Flashbacks during Money Heist season 2 show Berlin (Pedro Alonso) - the Professor's brother - explaining how the heist could happen a few years before season 1 began.From there, Money Heist seasons 1 and 2 have a reasonably straightforward timeline of events. It begins with the Professor saving Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó) from the police and assembling the team of robbers for the Royal Mint of Spain heist. The Professor and his team take five months to construct and go over the plan for the job.

                   <p>The Money Heist season 3 picks up two or three years after the Royal Mint of Spain heist with Rio captured by Europol. This                       forces the Professor to use Berlin's plan for the Bank of Spain heist with the hopes that Rio can be freed in the process.                       The Professor brings Tokyo, Helsinki, Nairobi, and Denver back for the heist and adds Stockholm, Manila, Lisbon, Bogotá,                       Palermo, and Marseille to the team. Only Nairobi has died amid the Bank of Spain heist, but the job isn't over at the end                       of Money Heist season 4
