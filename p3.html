              <article>
                   <p>Walter White, a chemistry teacher, discovers that he has cancer and decides to get into the meth-making business to repay his medical debts. His priorities begin to change when he partners with Jesse. At first of Breaking Bad, high school chemistry teacher Walter White is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. After finding out from Hank Schrader, his DEA agent brother-in-law, how profitable cooking meth can be, Walt teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his, to make enough money to provide for his family after he's gone.

                   <p>TWalter and Jesse Pinkman’s camaraderie is one fantastic facet of the show. Although Pinkman is often used by White as a pawn, they are frenemies, with a heartbreaking partners-in-crime relationship. Pinkman’s development is noteworthy as well; his transformation from a reckless and careless addict to a caring man whose actions are well-balanced with his emotions, and his desire to settle down to a more peaceful life is heartwarming.
                   </p>
                   <p>Walter White’s demise is literally poetry in motion. With his never-give-up attitude, Walter ultimately dies surrounded by his one true love; the meth machines. The process of making meth gave him a renewed sense of hope for life as well as took it away from it – he owed everything to the machines. It is considered one of the greatest endings on TV.<br>
